        <img src="images/abtus.jpg">
        <p> BigBlue is an environmentalist organization founded in 2010 by founder and current president, Fiona Sumugat. The organization was started by a small group of friends managing a small website and doing constant coastal cleanups. This eventually garnered the attention of the masses and it slowly grew to what it is today. As of now, BigBlue is one of the largest and most successful environmental organizations in the world.

        <h1> How to Help </h1>
        <p> There are countless ways to help our ocean! One of them is joining and becoming an active member of our organization! However, if it is difficult, then you can also help in your own way. One of these is segregating your own trash properly. This may seem like a small step, but it has a big impact on our environment. Encouraging your family and friends to do the same, can be tremendous help for our ocean. Another is to research and invite other people to partake in helping. This can include posters, blogs, websites, or even just a simple post on your social media. Raise awareness on the condition of our world and do as much as you can to help it.
